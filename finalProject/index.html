  # 👋 Hi, I'm Amiliah Cuffie-Sharpe!

## About Me
I'm a Aspiring developer who loves coding.  
Currently working on HTML and CSS.  
Always learning more about JavaScript and Pyton.

## Introduction
  To me, coding is more than just writing lines of instructions, it’s a form of expression, problem-solving, and continuous learning. It gives me the ability to turn ideas into real, functioning tools and to build something meaningful from nothing but logic and creativity. Coding challenges me to think critically, adapt to new concepts, and embrace failure as part of the growth process. It’s empowering to know that with enough persistence and curiosity, I can create solutions, automate tasks, or even build something that helps others. Ultimately, coding feels like having a superpower—one that unlocks endless possibilities in the digital world.

## 🛠️ Skills
-  Languages: `JavaScript` | `Python` | `HTML` | `CSS`

## Career Path
  Coding within computer science is the practice of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the software that powers everything from mobile apps to large-scale systems. It involves turning complex problems into logical solutions using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or C++. A career in coding blends creativity with analytical thinking, allowing professionals to build applications, automate tasks, and contribute to cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science. As technology continues to evolve, coding remains a foundational skill in shaping the digital world and solving real-world challenges through innovation.
